# Overview

This guide describes the process to create a Setup project (.msi installer) for a VSTO Outlook add-in developed using Visual Studio 2019.  Add-ins created with earlier versions of Visual Studio may need their existing Setup project deleted and recreated.

# Install the Visual Studio Installer Projects extension

By default, Visual Studio 2019 does not have a Setup project template.  These templates can be added by installed the Visual Studio Installer Projects extension.

* Open Visual Studio.
* Select Extensions... Manage Extensions.
* Search online for Microsoft Visual Studio Installer
